                        Population protocols provide a basic model that allows us to perform arbitrary computation through asymmetric **interactions** of finite-state **agents** organized in an **interaction graph**.

                        ## Population Protocols
                        - The interaction graph's nodes are the agents in our system. An edge in this graph indicates that two nodes can interact with each other.
                        - When two nodes interact, their states are updated by looking up their previous states in the transition table and setting their states to this value.
                        - Interactions are asymmetric, i.e., one agent is the initiator and the other is the responder.
                        - One interaction occurs at every iteration of the protocol. The scheduler picks what agents perform this interaction.
                        - Agents have O(1) state, but this requirement has been relaxed in some extensions of the model.

                        ## Population Protocols
                        - Scheduler: The scheduler decides which two pairs of agents should interact at every iteration of the protocol.
                            - The scheduler is an adversary in the original model, but some modifications of the model enforce a random scheduler.
                        - Fairness Condition: We do not allow the scheduler to avoid a possible step forever.
                            - This is quite important if the scheduler is an adversary.

                        ## Population Protocols

                        - When we start the system, the input is distributed to the agents using the input function.
                        - At the end of every interaction, the state of the entire interaction graph can be converted to our output alphabet using the output function.

                        ## Basic Demo (Leader Election)

                        - The graph starts with all nodes being red.
                        - Red nodes are leaders and blue nodes are followers.
                        - Goal: Single leader remaining

                        ## Properties
                        - Anonymous: No agent can identify other agents. Some variants of the model relax this requirement.
                        - Stable: Population protocols generally cannot detect when they have finished; instead, the agents' outputs are required to converge after some finite time to a common, correct value.

                        ## Properties
                        - Uniform: The protocol's specification has no dependence on the number of agents in the system.
                        - Unpredictable (but fair) Interactions: Because interactions can be selected in an adversarial manner, the interaction patterns are unpredictable.
                            - To ensure that progress is made, the adversary must be fair.

                        - Configuration: A list of all of the agents' states at a specific point in time.
                        - Execution: A sequence of computations `$C_0, C_1, ...$` where `$C_0$` is the initial configuration and `$\forall i \ge 0, C_i \longrightarrow C_{i+1}$`.
                        - Time: The total number of steps for the system to converge.
                        - Parallel Time: The average number of steps initiated by any agent (i.e., total time divided by the number of agents).

                        - `$Y$`, the output alphabet,
                        - `$\iota$`, a mapping from `$\Sigma$` to `$Q$` which maps the input to input states for the agents within our interaction graph,
                        - `$\omega$`, a mapping from `$Q$` to `$Y$` which maps the state of agent to an output within our system,
                        - `$\delta \subseteq Q^4$`, a transition function which describes how agents interact with each other.

                        - Semilinear Sets: A semilinear set is a subset of $\mathbb{N}^d$ that is a finite union of linear sets of the form {$b$ + $k_1 a_1$ + ··· + $k_m a_m$}, where $b$ is a $d$-dimensional base vector, $a_1$ through $a_m$ are basis vectors, and $k_1$ through $k_m$ are non-negative coefficients.
                        - Presburger Arithmetic: Arithmetic on the natural numbers with addition but not multiplication. Presburget Arithmetic allows for quantifier elimination, allowing us to eliminate universal and existential quantifiers.

                        ## Proof Intuition

                        - A predicate is computable in the basic population protocol model if it is semilinear:
                            - To prove this, we need to prove that population protocols can compute the following operations:
                                - Addition (`$+$`)
                                - Mod-k congruence for each constant `$k$` (`$\equiv_{k}$`)
                                - Logical AND, OR, and NEGATE operators (`$\land \lor \neg$`)

                        ## Proof Intuition

                        - A predicate is semilinear if it is computable in the basic population protocol model:
                            - Population protocols can be "pumped" by adding extra input tokens that turn out not to affect the final output. Using this, we can show that the positive inputs to a population protocol (considered as sets of vectors) can be separated into a collection of cones over some finite set of minimal positive inputs, and that each of these cones can be further expressed using only a finite set of basis vectors.

                        ## Computation by Epidemics

                        - An epidemic starting from one infected agent spreads to all agents in $\Theta(\log{N})$ time with high probability
                        - 1 leader agent sends instruction opcodes to worker agents (using epidemic).
                        - Leader collects response (if necessary) from counter-epidemic, updates its state, and starts a new cycle.
                        - Leader moves to the next instruction using a phase clock.

                            - Agents can sense their entire neighborhood.
                            - All agents run synchronously.
                        - Asynchronous Cellular Automata:
                            - Assumes that an agent can learn the states of all its neighbors simultaneously, in contrast to the pairwise interactions that form the basis of population protocols.

                            - If our random scheduler uses some sort of underlying probability distribution, then we can create a Markov chain:
                                - At each configuration, we have a probability distribution on the set of possible successor configuration.
